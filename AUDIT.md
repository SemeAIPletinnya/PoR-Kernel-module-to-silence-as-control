# Proof-of-Resonance Audit (AUDIT.md)

## Purpose

A Proof-of-Resonance (PoR) Audit is an **independent technical evaluation** of an LLM, agent, or AI pipeline.

It evaluates:

* coherence stability
* semantic drift
* consensus behavior
* silence-gating correctness

This is **not**:

* a penetration test
* a model tuning service
* a consulting engagement

This **is**:

* a control-layer evaluation
* a stability and reliability assessment
* an external technical opinion

## Scope

Audits may be conducted on:

* LLM-based agents
* multi-agent systems
* AI pipelines (LLM + tools)
* safety-critical reasoning systems

No source code transfer is required unless explicitly agreed.

## Deliverables

Each audit produces:

* PoR Stability Summary
* Drift & Failure Profile
* Control Recommendations (respond / gate / silence)
* Optional cryptographic attestation

## Limitations

* Audits do **not** guarantee correctness or safety in all conditions
* Audits reflect the system **at the evaluated snapshot only**
* No performance or business claims are made

## Commercial Terms

Audits are offered on a paid basis.
Pricing and scope are agreed privately.

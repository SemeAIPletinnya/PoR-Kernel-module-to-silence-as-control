# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project currently supports the latest code on the `main` branch. Older versions are not maintained.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please open a private security advisory or contact the maintainers directly rather than filing a public issue.

When reporting, include:

- A clear description of the issue and potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the problem.
- Any relevant logs or proof-of-concept details.

We will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible and work to provide a fix.

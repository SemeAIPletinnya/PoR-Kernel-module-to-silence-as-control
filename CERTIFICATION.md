# Proof-of-Resonance Certification (CERTIFICATION.md)

## What Certification Is

Proof-of-Resonance Certification is a **formal technical attestation** that a system:

* was evaluated using PoR methodology
* met defined stability and coherence thresholds
* implements silence-gating correctly

Certification is **not**:

* a guarantee of correctness
* a safety approval
* an endorsement of business claims

## What Certification Grants

Certified systems may:

* state that they were "PoR-evaluated"
* reference Proof-of-Resonance certification
* include certification references in technical documentation

## Certification Process

1. Initial PoR Audit
2. Review against certification thresholds
3. Attestation issuance
4. Time-bound certification period

## Renewal

Certification expires and must be renewed periodically.
Re-certification may require re-evaluation.

## Governance

* Certification decisions are final
* Certification may be revoked if misuse or misrepresentation occurs
* Certification volume is intentionally limited

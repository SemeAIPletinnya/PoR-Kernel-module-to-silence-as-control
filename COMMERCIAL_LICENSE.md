# Commercial License (COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md)

## Licensing Philosophy

This project is open-source by default.

However, **commercial and production use** of Silence-as-Control and PoR kernel logic requires a commercial license.

The intent is to:

* keep research open
* protect kernel integrity
* enable sustainable development

## Commercial Use Includes

A commercial license is required if the software is used:

* in production systems
* in SaaS or paid products
* in enterprise internal tooling
* in safety-critical or regulated environments

## Not Considered Commercial Use

* academic research
* personal experimentation
* open-source research projects
* non-production prototypes

## License Scope

The commercial license grants:

* right to use the software in production
* right to modify internally
* no obligation to disclose source

It does **not** grant:

* ownership of the kernel
* right to relicense the kernel
* right to claim authorship

## Duration

Licenses are time-bound and renewable.
Terms are agreed directly with the project author.
